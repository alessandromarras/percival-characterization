## Coding style guide

The PERCIVAL characterization software framework is developed in Python 3.
We try as much as we can to follow the PEP-8 recommendations. 
Please, try as much as you can to follow these recommendations.
A complete style guide for python can be found here: [PEP8 -- syle guide for python code here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
There are some tools developed which will check if your code is PEP-8 compatible and if not it will suggest some modifications.
As an example, you can either [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) use or [pylint](https://www.pylint.org).

N.B.: Pull Request not following the Python coding style guide might be rejected.

## General guidelines

* Please commit as often as possible
* To make any modification (fixing a bug, developing a new method) please do not work on the master branch, but create a feature branch
* Use descriptive commits
* Follow the style of the existing coding (see PEP8 recommendations)
